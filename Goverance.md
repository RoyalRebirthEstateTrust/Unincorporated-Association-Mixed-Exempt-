**Royal Rebirth Bank — Public Governance Structure**

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **governance principles, oversight mechanisms, and authority boundaries** for the public-facing activities of the Royal Rebirth Bank as a **privately organized Unincorporated Association (Mixed-Exempt)**.

It ensures:

* **Transparency** for stakeholders and auditors
* **Separation of public vs private authority**
* **Compliance with regulatory expectations**
* **Audit-ready governance records**
* **Codex-aligned, ceremonial and declarative structure**

> **Note:** Operational authority, treasury management, and reserve custody remain in **private repositories**. Public governance here **illustrates principles, not execution**.

---

## 2. Governance Principles

1. **Separation of Authority**

   * Public governance does not confer minting, treasury, or reserve authority.
   * Private issuer authority and treasury functions exist **solely in private repositories**.

2. **Codex Alignment**

   * Governance aligns with:

     * **Civilly Alive Codex**
     * **Codex-Aligned and Declarative**
     * **Dynasty Irrevocable Trust & Royal House of Jabbaar**

3. **Transparency & Auditability**

   * Public documents reflect governance oversight without disclosing sensitive operational details.
   * Audit-ready metrics include supply reporting, reserve attestations, and compliance confirmations.

4. **Integrity & Version Control**

   * All public governance documents are versioned and **hash-verified**.
   * Updates are logged with timestamp, author, and rationale.

| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Sovereign Author / Living Author**                            | Rashidah Madinah                                                  | Ultimate authority; declares governance and ceremonial alignment | Publicly acknowledged              |
| **Unincorporated Association — Board (Public Oversight Layer)** | Advisory & ceremonial board for transparency purposes             | Oversight of public interfaces and compliance display            | Documented in public repo          |
| **Public Compliance Officers**                                  | Maintain and verify public metrics, attestations, and disclosures | Public compliance alignment and reporting                        | Documented, no operational control |
| **Codex Trustees / Ceremonial Oversight**                       | Maintain codex-aligned structure                                  | Ensure ceremonial, declarative, and architectural consistency    | Publicly described                 |
| **Public Reporting Interfaces**                                 | Systems publishing supply metrics, API access, transparency logs  | Public interface only; no minting or reserve access              | Full public visibility             |

> **Important:** Operational execution, treasury management, and issuance authority remain **solely private**.

---

## 4. Oversight & Accountability

* Public governance ensures **audit trails** exist for any public-facing activity.
* **Internal reviews** of public disclosures occur periodically.
* Any anomalies or breaches are **escalated privately**, with **high-level public breach protocol** documented in `BREACH_RESPONSE_PUBLIC.md`.

---

## 5. Policy & Decision-Making

* Public governance **documents policies** without executing them.
* All decisions regarding token issuance, treasury, or reserves are **private issuer authority decisions**.
* Publicly visible governance includes:

  * Roles and responsibilities
  * Oversight principles
  * Compliance alignment
  * Transparency and reporting standards

---

## 6. Compliance Alignment

* Governance structure is compliant with **international mixed-exempt unincorporated association standards**.
* Publicly shared documents support:

  * Regulatory review
  * Auditor verification
  * Stakeholder confidence
* Private operational authority is **segregated** to protect reserves and issuance integrity.

---

## 7. Reporting & Documentation

* Public governance documents include:

  * `GOVERNANCE.md` → This file
  * `DECLARATION_OF_AUTHORITY.md` → Roles and authority declarations
  * `PUBLIC_COMPLIANCE_FRAMEWORK.md` → Public compliance standards
  * `RESERVE_ATTESTATION_PUBLIC.md` → Public reserve attestations
  * `SUPPLY_METRICS_PUBLIC.md` → Supply reporting and metrics
  * `PUBLIC_NETWORK_DIAGRAM.md` → Public interface architecture

* Version control, hash integrity, and timestamping ensure **audit-readiness**.

---

## 8. Public Notice

All public governance materials are:

* Ceremonial, codex-aligned, and declarative
* Fully auditable
* **Separate from private operations**
* Intended to demonstrate structured, transparent governance for stakeholders

> **Key Principle:** Public governance communicates principles and boundaries — it does **not** grant operational authority or control over private assets.


This document ensures that your **public repo now has full governance clarity**, leaves **no ambiguity about authority**, and **meets audit-ready compliance standards**.
