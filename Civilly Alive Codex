### *Public‑Safe Edition*  
### *Royal Capital Holdings — Governance Declaration*

---

## **1. Purpose**

This document affirms that the author, the estate, and the governance structures associated with Royal Capital Holdings are **active, present, and maintained**.

It serves as a **public declaration of civil presence**, ensuring that no system, platform, or observer treats the estate as abandoned, dormant, or without an active author.

This codex contains **no private information** and does not disclose any internal governance, identity, or trust details.

---

## **2. Civil Presence**

The estate is:

- **Active**  
- **Maintained**  
- **Continuously governed**  
- **Not abandoned**  
- **Not dormant**  
- **Not silent**

This codex stands as a public affirmation of ongoing civil presence.

---

## **3. Governance Principle**

**Private controls the Public.  
Public and Private never mix.**

This principle governs:

- documentation boundaries  
- vessel separation  
- operational behavior  
- public‑facing materials  
- internal vs. external roles  

The Private layer defines identity and authority.  
The Public layer reflects and implements those definitions.

This codex does **not** contain private governance rules.

---

## **4. Vessel Separation**

The system operates through clearly separated vessels, each with its own role and boundary.

This codex does not describe internal vessel logic.  
It simply affirms that:

- vessels exist  
- vessels are active  
- vessels are maintained  
- vessels do not cross lanes  
- vessels do not collapse into each other  

This protects clarity, continuity, and operational integrity.

---

## **5. Non‑Consent to Mislabeling**

The estate does **not** consent to:

- being treated as abandoned  
- being treated as inactive  
- being treated as ungoverned  
- being treated as without an author  

This codex stands as a public correction to any such assumptions.

---

## **6. Public‑Safe Boundary**

This document:

- contains no private identifiers  
- contains no personal data  
- contains no trust details  
- contains no account information  
- contains no legal claims  
- contains no confidential material  

It is purely a **public‑safe declaration of civil presence**.

---

## **7. Living Document**

This codex may be updated to reflect:

- structural changes  
- governance clarifications  
- vessel adjustments  
- public‑safe notices  

All updates remain within the same public‑safe boundary.
