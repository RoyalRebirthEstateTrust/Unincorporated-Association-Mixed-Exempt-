# Royal Rebirth Bank — Public Governance & Compliance Repository

## Overview

This repository represents the **public-facing governance and compliance architecture** of the Royal Rebirth Bank, organized as a **privately structured Unincorporated Association (Mixed-Exempt)** within the **Estate & Trust Private Wealth Architecture**.

The purpose of this repository is to:

* Demonstrate **transparent governance principles**
* Provide **compliance-ready documentation** for public review
* Serve as a **public interface** for the Royal Rebirth Stable Coin issuance
* Maintain **strict separation** from private issuer, reserve, and treasury operations

>  All operational infrastructure, custody, and signing authorities remain in **private repositories**. This public repo is for **transparency, audit, and regulatory clarity only**.

## Key Principles

1. **Separation of Authority**

   * Public repositories and interfaces do **not** control issuance, treasury, or reserves.
   * Private issuer authority and reserves are isolated in private repositories.

2. **Governance & Compliance**

   * Public documentation reflects internal **governance policies** and compliance alignment.
   * Audit trails are maintained without disclosing **sensitive operational details**.

3. **Transparency & Auditability**

   * All public metrics, supply reporting, and attestations are included without revealing **custody locations, wallets, or private keys**.
   * Publicly accessible policies provide clarity for regulators, partners, and auditors.

4. **Codex Alignment**

   * Public materials are aligned with ceremonial and structural codices:

     * **Civilly Alive Codex**
     * **Codex‑Aligned and Declarative**
